# DeepfakeGen-Detector
Deepfakes, generated through sophisticated deep learning techniques, manipulate videos to create hyper-realistic but entirely fabricated content. These advancements pose critical challenges in various sectors, including politics, entertainment, security, and social media, as they can be used for malicious purposes such as spreading misinformation, defaming individuals, and manipulating public opinion. Therefore, there is an urgent need for robust and reliable deepfake detection systems to mitigate these threats. This project focuses on developing a comprehensive video deepfake detection framework leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning architectures.

1.	Develop a dataset of real and deepfake videos.
2.	Train and evaluate the model on the prepared dataset.
3.	Optimize the model for better accuracy and robustness.
4.	Develop a user-friendly interface for real-time deepfake video detection.
